# Course Scheduler
This is a program that I built to index and organize courses in a tentative timetable to make it easy to decide which courses to take. It first data mines the website where all of the Lethbridge course offerings are, stores all of the information in a local database, and then allows the user to choose which courses they would like to include in the main table. All of the prerequisites are listed so that it is easy to see which courses one is able to take.

After the user hits submit, it goes back to the main table and organizes all of the data in a way that makes it easy to see where conflicts could arise and thus helps the user to pick which courses they want to take to organize their schedule in a way that they prefer. The course number and section letter are clearly listed and their registration numbers and additional information are listed in a table underneath so that the user can easily use that information to make decisions based on which professor is teaching each course, and reference the registration numbers easily when it is time to register.
