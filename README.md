# Course Scheduler
This is a program that I built to index and organize courses in a tentative timetable to make it easy to decide which courses to take. It first data mines the website where all of the Lethbridge course offerings are, stores all of the information in a local database, and then allows the user to choose which courses they would like to include in the main table.

After the user hits submit, it goes back to the main table and organizes all of the data in a way that makes it easy to see where conflicts could arise and thus helps the user to pick which courses they want to take to organize their schedule in a way that they prefer.
